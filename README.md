# TFG_Cross-Domain-y-la-Seguridad-de-los-datos
The present GradoÂ´s Thesis consists of a study of the different solutions for client-side communication, emphasizing the problem of crossing domains, and data security. An analysis of different forms of existing communications from the front or client side will be carried out, explaining in each case its advantages and limitations. Finally, the need to control the origin and security of the data sent and received, both on the client side and on the server side, will be explained. A proof of concept will be developed using each of the communication methods shown in the document, in order to check their possibilities, limitations and security. To control the data security, the Open Source OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI) library will be used, which will also be included in the proof of concept.
